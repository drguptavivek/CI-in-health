## Exact Legal / Regulatory Criteria (primary text)

### A) “Critical infrastructure” — definition + sectors
**Definition (section 2):** “critical infrastructure” means an infrastructure that is:
* **related to a sector specified in Schedule 1**, and
* **provides an essential service in Hong Kong**, and
* the disruption/compromise described in the definition would **hinder or substantially affect** maintenance of **critical societal and economic activities in Hong Kong**. ([Legislative Council of Hong Kong][1])
**Schedule 1 sectors** (for the definition of “critical infrastructure”) include: **Energy; Information technology; Banking and financial services; Air transport; Land transport; Maritime transport; Healthcare services; Telecommunications and broadcasting services**. ([Legislative Council of Hong Kong][1])


### B) “Specified critical infrastructure” — which regulator applies
For a **critical infrastructure** to be a **specified critical infrastructure** (section 2(3)):
* it must be **related to** a sector in **Schedule 1**, and
* it is specified **for a designated authority** if it is related to a sector in **Schedule 2** and is operated by a **regulated organization** in Schedule 2; otherwise it is specified **for the Commissioner**. ([Legislative Council of Hong Kong][1])
**Designated authorities in Schedule 2:**
* **Monetary Authority** (for **Banking and financial services**)
* **Communications Authority** (for **Telecommunications and broadcasting services**) ([Legislative Council of Hong Kong][1])
**Regulating authority rule (section 5):** the **Commissioner** is the regulating authority for CI operators **unless** the operator operates a specified critical infrastructure specified for a **designated authority**, in which case the **designated authority** regulates that operator. ([Legislative Council of Hong Kong][1])


### C) CI operator — designation test (section 12)
A regulating authority may **designate an organization** as a **CI operator** if the authority determines the organization has **ownership or control** in relation to the **operation** of the whole or part of a specified critical infrastructure, including (examples listed in section 12(2)):
* ownership/control of the whole/part of the infrastructure;
* operation of the whole/part;
* ability to **direct or influence** the operation. ([Legislative Council of Hong Kong][1])
In deciding whether to designate, section 12(3) lists factors including:
* **degree of ownership or control** in relation to operation;
* whether the organization can **direct or influence** the operation;
* any other factor the authority considers relevant. ([Legislative Council of Hong Kong][1])


### D) Critical computer system — designation test (section 13)
A regulating authority may **designate a computer system** as a **critical computer system** of a specified critical infrastructure if (section 13(1)):
* it is a computer system **operated by** the CI operator or another person;
* it is **accessible by the CI operator in or from Hong Kong**; and
* it is **essential to the core function** of the infrastructure. ([Legislative Council of Hong Kong][1])
In designating, section 13(2) lists factors including:
* extent to which the system is essential to the core function;
* whether it can be substituted;
* effect of compromise on operation/provision of essential service;
* connectivity/exposure;
* other factor the authority considers relevant. ([Legislative Council of Hong Kong][1])


## Obligations on CI operators (Part 4)

### Category structure (definitions)
* **Category 1 obligation:** an obligation in **Division 1 of Part 4** ([Legislative Council of Hong Kong][1])
* **Category 2 obligation:** an obligation in **Division 2 of Part 4** ([Legislative Council of Hong Kong][1])
* **Category 3 obligation:** an obligation in **Division 3 of Part 4** ([Legislative Council of Hong Kong][1])


### Category 1 obligations (examples)
**Section 19 — Office in Hong Kong / contact means:** CI operator must **maintain an office in Hong Kong** and **provide the regulating authority** with (among other items) the **address**, and the **means** by which the operator may be contacted. ([Legislative Council of Hong Kong][1])
**Section 21 — Computer-system security management unit:** CI operator must **establish a unit** (however described) responsible for computer-system security of critical computer systems and must provide specified particulars to the regulating authority. ([Legislative Council of Hong Kong][1])


### Category 2 obligations (management plan + change notification + risk assessment + audit)
**Section 22 — Notify certain events within 1 month:** if events listed in section 22(2) occur (including material change to design/configuration/security/operation of a critical computer system; removal of a critical computer system; adding an accessible system essential to core function; or change making an existing accessible system essential to core function), the CI operator must **notify** the regulating authority **within 1 month** of the event. ([Legislative Council of Hong Kong][1])
**Section 23 — Submit & implement a computer-system security management plan (3 months):** CI operator must submit the plan **within 3 months after the operator’s designation date** (extendable on application), and implement it; the plan must cover all matters in **Schedule 3**; revisions must be submitted **within 1 month** of revision. ([Legislative Council of Hong Kong][1])
**Section 24 — Risk assessments (first within 12 months; then annually):**
* first risk assessment: **within 12 months** after designation date;
* subsequent: **at least once every 12 months** after expiry of the first period;
* report to regulator: **within 3 months** after expiry of the period for conducting the assessment (extendable on application). ([Legislative Council of Hong Kong][1])
**Section 25 — Audits (first within 24 months; then every 24 months):**
* first audit: **within 24 months** after designation date;
* subsequent: **at least once every 24 months** after expiry of the first period;
* report to regulator: **within 3 months** after expiry of the period for carrying out the audit (extendable on application). ([Legislative Council of Hong Kong][1])


### Category 3 obligations (drills + emergency response plan + incident reporting)
**Section 26 — Participation in drills:** Commissioner may require a CI operator to participate in a computer-system security drill (after reasonable notice). ([Legislative Council of Hong Kong][1])
**Section 27 — Emergency response plan (3 months):** CI operator must submit an emergency response plan to the Commissioner **within 3 months** after designation date (extendable on application), revisions within **1 month**, and must implement the plan; the plan must cover matters in **Part 2 of Schedule 3**. ([Legislative Council of Hong Kong][1])
**Section 28 — Notify incidents + follow-on written report (Schedule 6 times):**
* notification must be made “as soon as practicable” and **within the specified time**;
* if initial notice not in specified form/way, a written record must be submitted;
* CI operator must further submit a written report within the specified time. ([Legislative Council of Hong Kong][1])
**Schedule 6 — specified times (examples shown in the schedule table):**
* **within 12 hours** in the circumstances set out in item 1(a);
* **within 48 hours** in item 1(b);
* **within 14 days** for the written report in item 2. ([Legislative Council of Hong Kong][1])


### HEALTH
There is **one explicit health-specific element** in the Ordinance, and the rest is written in **sector-neutral** terms.
1. **Healthcare is explicitly a “sector” for CIs**
* **Schedule 1** lists **“Healthcare services”** as a **sector specified for the definition of “critical infrastructure.”** ([Legislative Council of Hong Kong][1])
2. **No health-specific “designated authority” is listed**
* **Schedule 2** specifies designated authorities for only:
  * **Monetary Authority** — sector: **Banking and financial services**
  * **Communications Authority** — sector: **Telecommunications and broadcasting services** ([Legislative Council of Hong Kong][1])
3. **Obligations are framed for “CI operators” generally (not a health-only sub-regime)**
* The Ordinance structures compliance as **“Part 4 — Obligations of CI Operator”** (with Divisions for organization, prevention, and incident reporting/response). ([Legislative Council of Hong Kong][1])
So, the **health-specific hook** is the inclusion of **“Healthcare services”** in **Schedule 1**; the remaining designation/obligation machinery is expressed at the **CI operator / critical computer system** level. ([Legislative Council of Hong Kong][1])

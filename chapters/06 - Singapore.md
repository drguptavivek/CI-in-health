## **Final Categories**

**Cybersecurity Act (2018; amended 2024)**

* **Critical Information Infrastructure (CII)** — a **computer or computer system** designated under **section 7(1)** (i.e., system-level designation, not “whole organisations/sectors”). ([Cyber Security Agency of Singapore][1])

**CII sector coverage (policy statement):**

* CSA identifies **Healthcare** as one of the critical sectors in scope for CII-protected essential services. ([Cyber Security Agency of Singapore][1])


## **Exact Legal/Regulatory Criteria (designation test)**

Under **section 7(1)** (as described in CSA’s official FAQ and the Act’s Explanatory Statement), a system may be designated as CII where it is:

1. **Located wholly or partly in Singapore**, and
2. **Necessary for the continuous delivery of an “essential service”**, and
3. The system’s **loss or compromise** will have a **debilitating effect on the availability** of that essential service in Singapore. ([Cyber Security Agency of Singapore][1])
**“Essential service” framing (why healthcare can qualify):** the Explanatory Statement describes “essential service” as a service essential to national-level interests (including **public health**) and **specified in the First Schedule**. ([Isomer User Content][2])
**Designation mechanics and duration:**
* Designation is **by written notice** to the system owner. ([Isomer User Content][2])
* Designation takes effect for **5 years** unless withdrawn earlier; CSA explains this as allowing periodic re-evaluation as circumstances change. ([Isomer User Content][2])


## **Grading/Tiering Schemes**

* **No published multi-tier grading** for CII designation — the regime is essentially **designated CII vs non-CII** (with the list of designated CII itself not public). ([Cyber Security Agency of Singapore][1])


## **Obligations once designated (high-level; from official explanatory material + CSA CII Code)**

From the Cybersecurity Act Explanatory Statement, CII owners’ duties include (among others):

* comply with **Codes of Practice / Standards of Performance** and directions,
* **report prescribed cybersecurity incidents**,
* undergo **audits at least once every 2 years**,
* perform **cybersecurity risk assessments at least once a year**, and
* participate in **cybersecurity exercises** if required. ([Isomer User Content][2])
CSA publishes the **Cybersecurity Code of Practice for CII (PDF)** under its legislation resources (non-compliance is enforceable via directions under the Act, per the Explanatory Statement). ([Cyber Security Agency of Singapore][3])


## **Healthcare information systems “most likely” designated CII**

**Strict evidentiary position (what can be said publicly):**

* **CSA states the list of CII and CII owners is secret for national security reasons**, and **CII refers to specific computers/systems explicitly designated** (not “firms and sectors”). Therefore **specific health systems (e.g., NEHR, ED systems, etc.) cannot be confirmed as CII from public sources**. ([Cyber Security Agency of Singapore][1])

**Related but not a CII designation list (health sector cyber requirements):**

* MOH has issued **Cyber and Data Security Guidelines for Healthcare Providers** in the context of safe contribution/access to **NEHR** (this is a healthcare-sector cyber baseline document, not a publication of CII designations). ([Health Information][4])


## **Public vs Confidential**

**Public:**

* CSA publicly describes the **CII definition** and **critical sector scope** (including healthcare) and links to CII regulatory materials and Codes of Practice. ([Cyber Security Agency of Singapore][1])

**Confidential:**

* **The list of CII and CII owners is secret** (CSA’s explicit statement). ([Cyber Security Agency of Singapore][1])


## **Latest Updates (2024–2026) — what can be evidenced from official sources**

* CSA states **amendments to the Cybersecurity Act were passed in Parliament in May 2024**, including updates to the CII provisions (and new regulated classes like STCC/ESCI/FDI). ([Cyber Security Agency of Singapore][5])
* CSA’s legislation pages show the current published **CII Code of Practice** and its last-updated date on the site. ([Cyber Security Agency of Singapore][3])

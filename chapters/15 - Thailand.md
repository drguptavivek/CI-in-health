## Final categories (what is “highest critical / protected”)

* **“Critical Information Infrastructure” (CII)** — defined term in the **Cybersecurity Act, B.E. 2562 (2019)** (unofficial English translation in Government Gazette format). 
* **“Organization of Critical Information Infrastructure” (CII Organization)** — defined term in the **Cybersecurity Act, B.E. 2562 (2019)**. 
* **Cyber Threat levels** — **non-critical / critical / crisis** levels defined in the **Cybersecurity Act, B.E. 2562 (2019)**. 

## Exact legal / regulatory criteria (what triggers inclusion)

### Subsection A (The Definition): the specific text defining the scope

* **“Critical Information Infrastructure”**: “the computer or computer system” used by a Government Agency or private organization in operations relating to **maintaining national security, public security, national economic security, or infrastructures in the public interest**. 
* **“Organization of Critical Information Infrastructure”**: a Government Agency or private organization that **has a mission of or provides a CII service**. 
* **Committee designation power (Section 49):** the Committee prescribes (by notification) characteristics of organizations with missions/services in specified aspects, including **“public health”**. 

### Subsection B (The Thresholds): quantitative or qualitative tests

* **Aspect-based trigger (qualitative):** Section 49 lists aspects for which organizations may be prescribed as CII Organizations; **“public health”** is one listed aspect. 
* **Case-by-case review (qualitative):** Section 49 states the Committee “shall consider and review… on a case-by-case basis.” 
* **No numeric outage/time thresholds** for CII designation appear in the provided Act text. 

## Grading / tiering scheme

* **Three-level Cyber Threat classification (Section 60):** **non-critical level / critical level / crisis level**. 
* **Public health referenced in threat effects (Section 60(2)):** “critical level” includes effects on “...economy, **public health**, public safety, or the public order…” such that the CII operation could not operate or provide service. 

## Incident reporting tests and thresholds

### Deadlines

* **Section 57 (CII incident reporting):** where a Cyber Threat is “significantly occurring” to a CII Organization’s system, it “shall report” to the Office and the Supervising/Regulating Organization; the CRC “may prescribe criteria and method” of reporting. **No fixed hour/day deadline is stated in Section 57 in the provided Act text.** 
* **Section 58 (“without delay”):** if examination shows there is or may be a Cyber Threat to an information system under a Government Agency or CII Organization, the organization shall notify the Office and its Supervising/Regulating Organization **“without delay.”** 
* **Section 54 (annual assessment + 30-day submission):** a CII Organization must conduct risk assessment / cybersecurity examination **at least once per year** and submit a summary report to the Office **within 30 days** after completion. 

### Triggers (what counts as a reportable incident)

* **Section 57 trigger:** “Cyber Threat significantly occurring” to the system of a CII Organization. 
* **Section 58 trigger:** examination results show there “is or may be” a Cyber Threat to the relevant information system. 
* **Penalty for non-reporting (Section 73):** failure by a CII Organization to report a Cyber Threat incident under Section 57 (without reasonable cause) — **fine not exceeding Baht 200,000**. 

## Health information systems “most likely” designated

* **Explicit in the provided primary text:** Section 49 includes **“public health”** as an aspect for which the Committee may prescribe organizations as CII Organizations. 
* **Not specified in the provided primary text:** the Cybersecurity Act text provided does **not** enumerate specific **health information system types** (e.g., EHR, LIS, radiology PACS) as CII, and does **not** provide a published list of designated health entities within the provided documents. 
* **Process stated in the Act:** designation occurs via **Committee notification** prescribing characteristics of organizations in the listed aspects (including public health), with consideration rules published in the Government Gazette and case-by-case review. 

## Public vs Confidential

* **Public (in provided primary text):**

  * The Act states that Committee rules for consideration under Section 49 “shall be published in the Government Gazette.” 
* **Confidentiality obligations in provided health-sector primary text (separate statute):**

  * **National Health Act, B.E. 2550 (2007), Section 7:** “Personal health information shall be kept confidential,” and disclosure is restricted except by the person’s will or where required by specific law. 

## Latest updates (2025–2026)

* **No 2025–2026 amendments / Royal Gazette notifications were provided in primary-text PDF form** in the uploaded materials that can be cited as authoritative legal text for this chapter’s “updates” section.
* A **non-primary commentary article** was uploaded (“Lexology / Silk Legal”, dated Dec 24, 2025) describing a September 2025 NCSC notification and stating it was published in the Royal Gazette on 16 Sept 2025; **this chapter does not treat that article as primary legal evidence** and therefore does not use it to assert the content of the notification.

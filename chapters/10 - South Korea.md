## Final categories

**Act on the Protection of Information and Communications Infrastructure** (정보통신기반 보호법) establishes a **designation-based “critical infrastructure” regime** for **information and communications infrastructure**:

1. **Information and Communications Infrastructure** (정보통신기반) — defined term. ([E-Law][1])
2. **Critical Information and Communications Infrastructure** (주요정보통신기반시설) — **information and communications infrastructure designated** as “critical” by the head of a central administrative agency (or, for certain local-government-supervised organizations, by the competent Minister in consultation). ([E-Law][1])
3. **Management Organization** — an organization that manages critical information and communications infrastructure, with statutory duties to formulate and implement protection measures and related submissions/roles. ([E-Law][1])
The **Enforcement Decree** prescribes **procedures and required contents** for designation, publication/notification, vulnerability analysis timing, protection-measures submission, and incident notification contents. ([E-Law][2])


## Exact legal / regulatory criteria (primary texts)

## A) What may be designated as “critical”

A central administrative agency head may designate infrastructure under their jurisdiction as **critical information and communications infrastructure** by taking into account the **five factors** below:

1. national/social importance of duties performed by the managing organization
2. dependence of those duties on the infrastructure
3. inter-connection with other infrastructure
4. areas/extent of damage to national security, economy, society if an intrusion incident occurs
5. probability of intrusion incidents and ease of restoration ([E-Law][1])
Additional legal points in the Act on designation:

* The agency head **may request data** necessary to decide designation. ([E-Law][1])
* The agency head **may revoke** designation when the relevant affairs are abolished/suspended/changed. ([E-Law][1])
* The agency head must **submit designation/revocation for deliberation** by the Committee (with authority for the Committee to hear opinions). ([E-Law][1])
* The agency head must **publicly announce** designation/revocation **unless** the Committee deliberates that non-announcement is necessary for national security. ([E-Law][1])

## B) Decree: how “designation” is operationalized

The Decree specifies a stepwise process around a **“designation unit”** and evaluation:

* **Selection of designation units** (Decree Art. 13): central administrative agency head requires the organization to select a “designation unit,” and may examine/adjust reasonableness. ([E-Law][2])
* **Self-evaluation for designation** (Decree Art. 14): agency head may issue evaluation guidelines; organization evaluates and submits results. ([E-Law][2])
* **Review of evaluation** (Decree Art. 15): agency head reviews whether self-evaluation is objective/appropriate with reference to Act Art. 8(1) factors; may require re-evaluation in specified circumstances. ([E-Law][2])
* **Recommended designation decision timeline** (Decree Art. 16-2(3)): where designation is recommended under Act Art. 8-2(1), the agency head must decide whether to designate after designation-unit selection, self-evaluation, and review **within 60 days**. ([E-Law][2])

## C) Public notice / publication requirements (Act + Decree)

* Act: designation/revocation must be **publicly announced**, with a national-security exception after Committee deliberation. ([E-Law][1])
* Decree Art. 16: when designating or revoking designation, the agency head must notify the management organization “without delay” and publish specific fields in the **Official Gazette**:

  1. designation number
  2. name of critical information and communications infrastructure
  3. name of management organization
  4. performing duties
  5. grounds for designation/revocation ([E-Law][2])


## Obligations tied to “critical” designation (Act + Decree)

## A) Protection measures and submission

* Act Art. 5(1): management organization must formulate and implement **physical and technological** protection measures, linked to vulnerability analysis results. ([E-Law][1])
* Act Art. 5(2): management organization submits details of measures to the competent central administrative agency (with stated exception). ([E-Law][1])
* Decree Art. 8: measures for the following year must be submitted **by every August 31**. ([E-Law][2])

## B) Vulnerability analysis and timing

* Act Art. 9(1): management organization analyzes and evaluates vulnerabilities “on a regular basis as prescribed by Presidential Decree.” ([E-Law][1])
* Decree Art. 17(1)–(3):

  * first analysis within **6 months** of designation (extendable to **9 months** with approval, per stated condition)
  * thereafter **each year** (with an exception allowing earlier analysis if serious changes occur or deemed necessary)
  * if ordered under Act Art. 9(2), analysis within **6 months** of receiving the order ([E-Law][2])

## C) Roles (CISO concept)

* Act Art. 5(4): management organization designates a **chief information security officer** (with stated exception). ([E-Law][1])
* Decree Art. 9: specifies who may be designated and enumerates supervisory responsibilities (including measures, technical support requests, vulnerability analysis, compliance with guideline/measure orders, incident notification, and recovery measures). ([E-Law][2])

## D) Protection guidelines

* Act Art. 10: central administrative agencies may establish protection guidelines and recommend management organizations follow them; guidelines must be revised/supplemented regularly considering technological advancements. ([E-Law][1])
* Decree Art. 20(1)–(2): protection guidelines include (i) management/operation of an information protection system, (ii) vulnerability analysis & incident prevention, (iii) incident response & recovery; and must be notified to management organizations when formulated/revised/supplemented. ([E-Law][2])

## E) Cyber security incident notification content (Decree)
* Decree Art. 21(1): notification includes (1) date/time and facility, (2) details of damage, (3) other matters necessary for swift response and recovery. ([E-Law][2])


## Grading / tiering scheme

In the Act + Enforcement Decree texts cited above, **designation is a binary status** (designated or not designated as “critical information and communications infrastructure”); **no numeric or multi-tier classification scale** appears in these provisions. ([E-Law][1])


## What is public vs confidential

* **Public:** the Act requires public announcement of designation/revocation (subject to the national-security exception). ([E-Law][1])
* **Public:** the Decree requires Official Gazette publication of specific designation fields. ([E-Law][2])
* **May be withheld (national security):** the Act permits non-public announcement after Committee deliberation when necessary for guaranteeing national security. ([E-Law][1])

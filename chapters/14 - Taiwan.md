## Final categories (what is “highest critical / protected”)

1. **Critical infrastructure providers**

   **Primary basis:** **Cyber Security Management Act (CSMA)** — Chapter III, **Article 20** (designation + obligations for “critical infrastructure providers”). ([Law Moda][1])

2. **Specific non-government agencies** (regulated non-government entities, including CI providers and others covered by the Act)

   **Primary basis:** **CSMA** — Chapter III (e.g., **Articles 21–24** set obligations for “specific non-government agencies,” including incident notification/reporting mechanisms). ([Law Moda][1])

3. **Critical Information Infrastructure (CII)** (defined within Taiwan’s national CI protection guidance)

   **Primary basis:** **Executive Yuan Office of Homeland Security (OHS)** — *Guidelines for National Critical Infrastructure Protection* (definition of **CII** as systems/SCADA supporting continuous operation of national critical infrastructures). 


## Exact legal / regulatory criteria (what triggers inclusion)

### A) The Definition (scope text)

* **National Critical Infrastructure (CI)** definition (OHS Guidelines): assets/systems/networks (public/private; physical/virtual) whose disruption may negatively impact government/society, cause casualties, losses, economic downturn, environmental changes, or damage national security/interests. 
* **Critical Information Infrastructure (CII)** definition (OHS Guidelines): “vital information and communication systems or SCADA” dealing with core task functions and supporting continuous operation of national CI; managed under a single authority according to the CI sector it belongs to. 
* **Critical infrastructure providers** designation construct (CSMA Article 20): the central competent authority for the relevant sector **designates critical infrastructure providers**, submits the designation **for approval by the Executive Yuan**, and notifies approved entities in writing. ([Law Moda][1])

### B) The Thresholds (quantitative / qualitative tests)

* **No numeric thresholds are stated** in the cited legal text for when an entity becomes a “critical infrastructure provider.” The designation mechanism is described as an administrative designation/approval process (CSMA Article 20). ([Law Moda][1])


## Grading / tiering scheme

* **Cyber security responsibility levels (A–E)** (classified **from high to low**): **Level-A, Level-B, Level-C, Level-D, Level-E**.

  **Primary basis:** *Regulations on Classification of Cyber Security Responsibility Levels*, **Article 2** (as published in MODA’s CSMA-related regulations compilation). ([Ministry of Digital Affairs][2])

* **Incident severity levels (Level-1 to Level-4)** used for response requirements:

  The *Regulations on the Notification and Response of Cyber Security Incident* define **level-1, level-2, level-3, level-4** cyber security incidents (including distinctions involving **core business information**, **core information and communication systems**, scope of service interruption, and geographic/scale impact). ([Ministry of Digital Affairs][2])


## Incident reporting tests and thresholds

### Deadlines

From the *Regulations on the Notification and Response of Cyber Security Incident*:

* **Government agencies**:

  * Must **complete verification** within **8 hours** for **level-1/2** incidents and within **2 hours** for **level-3/4** incidents (Article 5). ([Ministry of Digital Affairs][2])
  * Must **complete damage control or recovery** within **72 hours** for **level-1/2** and within **36 hours** for **level-3/4** (Article 6). ([Ministry of Digital Affairs][2])

* **Specific non-government agencies** (including those designated):

  * When aware of a cyber security incident, must **notify** the central competent authority for the relevant sector; for **level-3/4**, notification must be **within 1 hour** (Regulations, Article 11). ([Ministry of Digital Affairs][2])
  * After completing damage control or recovery, must submit an **investigation/handling report**, and then submit a **corrective action report** (Articles 11–12). ([Ministry of Digital Affairs][2])

### Triggers (what counts as reportable)

* The same regulation defines incident **levels 1–4**; the level definitions reference (among other factors) whether the event affects **core business information** and/or a **core information and communication system**, and the scope/duration/extent of disruption (Article 2). ([Ministry of Digital Affairs][2])


## Health information systems “most likely” designated

* **Not stated in cited primary texts.**

  The OHS Guidelines classify national CI into **eight sectors**, one of which is **“emergency rescue and hospitals”**. The Guidelines also define **CII** as the vital ICT/SCADA supporting continuous CI operations. However, the cited sources do **not** publish a system-by-system list for healthcare. 


## Public vs Confidential

**Public (in cited sources):**

* CSMA (legal obligations and the designation mechanism for “critical infrastructure providers,” incident notification duty, etc.). ([Law Moda][1])
* OHS Guidelines (definitions of CI/CII; sector classification including hospitals). 
**Confidential (not evidenced here):**

* **Not stated in cited primary texts** whether the specific lists of designated providers/assets are public or confidential.
* The OHS Guidelines’ table of contents includes a section titled **“Classified and sensitive information/Confidentiality requirement”** (Chapter 4, Section 1), but this chapter does not claim what specific lists are or are not disclosed beyond what is explicitly shown. 


## Latest updates (2025–2026)

**Cyber Security Management Act revised and promulgated:**

* Taiwan’s official MODA law database shows the CSMA **“Date: 2025.09.24”** and notes it was **“Revised and promulgated a total of 35 articles… on September 24, 2025,”** with **“date of enforcement… determined by the Executive Yuan.”** ([Law Moda][1])

**Competent authority (as reflected in the revised CSMA text):**

* The same official text states **“The competent authority… is the Ministry of Digital Affairs”** (Article 2). ([Law Moda][1])

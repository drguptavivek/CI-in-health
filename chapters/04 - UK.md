# UNITED KINGDOM (UK)

### Final categories (what is “highest critical / protected” in this regime)
1. **Operator of Essential Services (OES) — Health (England)**
* The DHSC health-sector guide states that **“Healthcare services are an essential service under the NIS Regulations”** and that **“NHS trusts and foundation trusts, integrated care boards (ICBs) and certain independent providers [are] currently designated OESs for healthcare services.”** ([GOV.UK][1])
* The same guide states that **the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, acting through DHSC, is responsible for overseeing the NIS Regulations for OESs within the health sector in England** (i.e., DHSC is the competent authority for the England health sector). ([GOV.UK][1])
2. **Relevant Digital Service Provider (RDSP) — cross-sector category (often relevant to health supply chains)**
* The ICO’s Guide to NIS is explicitly for organisations providing digital services such as **online marketplaces, online search engines and cloud services**, and it explains RDSP obligations and the ICO’s role as the UK competent authority for RDSPs. ([ICO][2])
* The **NIS Regulations 2018** define **“digital service”** as including **(a) online marketplace, (b) online search engine, (c) cloud computing service**, and define **“cloud computing service.”** ([Legislation.gov.uk][3])
3. **Proposed expansion (Bill introduced 12 Nov 2025 — Bill 329)**
* The **Cyber Security and Resilience (Network and Information Systems) Bill** explanatory notes (within the Parliament PDF) describe new/expanded regulated roles including **relevant managed service providers (RMSPs)** and **critical suppliers**. ([UK Parliament][4])


### Exact legal / regulatory criteria (what triggers inclusion)

#### A) OES (Health sector, England)
* The DHSC guide states the health-sector OES landscape in England (NHS trusts/foundation trusts, ICBs, and certain independent providers are **currently designated** as OESs for healthcare services). ([GOV.UK][1])
* The DHSC guide states it is published under **regulation 3** guidance duties, and that OESs **must have regard to it** when carrying out security and incident reporting duties under the NIS Regulations. ([GOV.UK][1])

#### B) RDSP (ICO-regulated)
* The DHSC guide lists criteria for being an RDSP (all must apply), including providing an online search engine/online marketplace/cloud computing service in the UK; UK head office or nominated UK representative; and not being a micro/small enterprise (staff/turnover thresholds). ([GOV.UK][1])
* The ICO states its guide summarises obligations for **RDSPs** and explains the ICO’s role as competent authority for RDSPs. ([ICO][2])


### Incident reporting tests and thresholds (evidence only)

#### OES (Health, England) — “significant impact” + DHSC Table 1 thresholds
* The DHSC guide states that OES reports must be submitted **via the Data Security and Protection Toolkit (DSPT)** **without undue delay and, in any event, no later than 72 hours** after the OES became aware that an NIS incident has occurred. ([GOV.UK][1])
* The DHSC guide states OESs must assess significance having regard to **(i) number of users affected, (ii) duration, (iii) geographical area**, and provides **Table 1 thresholds** for the health sector definition of significant impact. ([GOV.UK][1])
**Examples of explicit Table 1 thresholds (DHSC):**
* **Excess fatalities:** > 0; **Potential clinical harm:** > 50 patients at risk. ([GOV.UK][1])
* **ED closure/diversion:** > 3 hours (major trauma centre); > 24 hours (all other organisations). ([GOV.UK][1])
* **Outpatient appointments cancelled:** 1,500; **Inpatient episodes cancelled:** 250. ([GOV.UK][1])
* **NHS111 services unavailable:** > 3 hours. ([GOV.UK][1])

#### RDSP (ICO) — 72-hour reporting requirement
* The ICO states: **notify the ICO without undue delay and not later than 72 hours** of becoming aware of any incident (where feasible). ([ICO][5])
* The ICO also states: **only RDSPs** notify the ICO; **OESs notify their sector competent authority**. ([ICO][5])


### Grading / tiering scheme (as published)
* The regime is **categorical by role** (e.g., **OES** vs **RDSP**) with different competent authorities and obligations, as reflected in the DHSC guide (OES) and ICO guidance (RDSP), and in the NIS Regulations’ definitions/structure. ([GOV.UK][1])


### Latest updates (2025–2026) — Bill introduced 12 Nov 2025 (Bill 329) (evidence only)
From the Bill’s explanatory notes:
* A **two-stage reporting structure** is described: **initial notification within 24 hours** of becoming aware, and **full notification within 72 hours** (described for OES incidents and similarly for RDSP incidents). ([UK Parliament][4])
* The notes also state that regulated entities must **send a copy of notifications to the CSIRT** (NCSC in its CSIRT capacity) **at the same time** as notifying the regulator. ([UK Parliament][4])
* The explanatory notes describe **managed services / RMSPs** and **critical suppliers** as added/expanded regulated categories. ([UK Parliament][4])

# NEW ZEALAND

### Final categories used in practice (evidence-based)
New Zealand does **not** present (in the sources available here) a single “health CII designation” law with a published list of designated health operators. Instead, the **operative “final categories”** relevant to *health information systems* come from three interacting layers:
1. **Health sector security framework (HISO 10029:2022)** — a **risk-based segmentation model** + **maturity scale**, intended to be applied to all health information (across the NZ health & disability sector).
2. **New Zealand Government security baseline (NZISM + PSR)** — for New Zealand Government information systems and protective security policy. ([nzism.gcsb.govt.nz][1])
   * NZISM is the NZ Government manual for information assurance / information systems security. ([nzism.gcsb.govt.nz][1])
   * PSR policy frameworks (including GOV and INFOSEC) are consolidated documents with “mandatory requirements” and were implemented **01 Oct 2025** (per the GOV policy framework document). 
3. **National resilience / “critical infrastructure” criticality tiers (NVA 2023)** — a national criticality lens used for infrastructure resilience analysis, including explicit tier thresholds such as **“Critical (National)”** based on scale of service loss (e.g., “> 100,000 customers”). 
   * This is **not health-sector-specific**, but it’s a key *country-level* source on how “critical national infrastructure” is being defined/thresholded in New Zealand. 


### Health sector: what HISO 10029:2022 *explicitly* requires / defines
**Scope and intent**
* HISO 10029:2022 sets out a **Health Information Security Framework** for the **health and disability sector**, intended to be **scalable** and used to “identify and manage” health information security risks.
* It explicitly anchors security outcomes to core properties like **Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability** (and broader obligations/expectations noted in the framework).
**Default sensitivity of health information**
* The framework states that **health information is considered “MEDICAL IN CONFIDENCE”** unless it is specifically classified otherwise.
**How “criticality” is handled for health systems (HISO segmentation model)**
* HISO uses a **segmentation model** that evaluates information/systems against risk characteristics (e.g., sensitivity, scale, business impact, exposure, etc.) to place them into segments, rather than declaring a single fixed “critical system” list.
* It also defines a **maturity scale (Levels 1–5)** to assess how well controls/processes are established and managed.
**Control alignment (important for “strictest standard” approach)**
* HISO maps/references common control catalogues and standards, including **NZISM** and **PSR**, along with ISO/IEC 27001, NIST CSF, CIS Controls, OWASP, etc.


### Government baseline: NZISM + PSR (what the sources strictly support)
* **NZISM** is presented by the NZ Government (GCSB/NZIC) as the government manual on information assurance and information systems security. ([nzism.gcsb.govt.nz][1])
* **PSR GOV Policy Framework** (Security Governance) is labelled as the “final V1.0 consolidated” framework, **implemented on 01 October 2025**, replacing earlier PSR policy content previously spread across webpages/publications. 
*(If you want me to bind specific NZISM control clauses into the NZ health write-up, I can—NZISM is a very large corpus, so we’d pull only the most relevant control sections once you tell me the target system profile.)* ([nzism.gcsb.govt.nz][1])


### National criticality tiers (resilience lens): NVA 2023 thresholds
The NVA 2023 Part B report includes an explicit tiering example for “criticality”, including:
* **Critical (National)**: failure causes **loss of service to >100,000 customers**, or loss to most of an urban area, or loss of supply to another nationally significant dependent customer/site. 
* **Critical (Regional/major)**: failure causes loss of service to **20,000–100,000** customers (and related regional criteria). 
Again: this source is about **critical infrastructure resilience** (lifelines-style framing), not a health-sector “CII designation” instrument. 


### Privacy and health information rules (evidence used)
**Health Information Privacy Code 2020 (HIPC 2020)**
* HIPC 2020 is issued by the Privacy Commissioner under the Privacy Act 2020, includes the health information privacy rules, and commenced **1 Dec 2020**. ([Privacy Commissioner][2])
**Notifiable privacy breach expectations (OPC guidance)**
* OPC states that if a privacy breach has caused or is likely to cause “serious harm”, agencies must notify the Privacy Commissioner and affected people “as soon as [they are] practically able”, and gives guidance that notification is expected **no later than 72 hours** after becoming aware of a notifiable breach. ([Privacy Commissioner][3])
**Access limitation note (transparency)**
* I attempted to open the primary legislation text on legislation.govt.nz directly, but it returned access errors (403/failed fetch) in this environment. So, for this NZ section, the **breach notification evidence** is grounded in the **OPC official guidance** and the **HIPC 2020 PDF**, rather than direct quoting from the Act text. ([Privacy Commissioner][3])


### What “strictest NZ-aligned standard” means for a health information system (still evidence-bounded)
If you want the **strictest** approach consistent with the sources above (without inventing non-existent “designation categories”):
* Use **HISO 10029:2022** to **segment** the system(s) and target a **high maturity level** (up to Level 5) appropriate to risk and business impact.
* Implement controls in a way that is demonstrably aligned to **NZISM** and **PSR** where applicable (HISO explicitly cross-maps to them). ([nzism.gcsb.govt.nz][1])
* Ensure privacy breach handling meets OPC expectations (including the **72-hour** guidance) and that health information handling aligns with **HIPC 2020**. ([Privacy Commissioner][3])

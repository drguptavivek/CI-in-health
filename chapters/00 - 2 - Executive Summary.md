# Executive Summary

This document compares how major jurisdictions identify health-related information systems and operators that receive the highest levels of cybersecurity and resilience obligations—whether framed as *critical information infrastructure*, *critical entities*, *essential services*, or equivalent constructs.

## Key findings

1. **Convergent prioritization of “life-and-safety” digital functions.** Across jurisdictions, the most consistently prioritized health capabilities include: emergency care and dispatch, hospital clinical operations (especially acute care), national/regional EHR exchanges, laboratory and diagnostic services, disease surveillance and outbreak response, and allocation/coordination systems (e.g., blood and organ allocation).

2. **Different “tests” to reach criticality.** Approaches span:
   - **quantitative thresholds** (e.g., service scale/volume, population impacted, incident impact metrics),
   - **qualitative significance tests** (e.g., debilitating effect on public health/safety), and
   - **combined models** that start qualitative but use quantitative triggers in guidance or incident definitions.

3. **Criteria are usually public; designated lists are often confidential.** Most regimes publish the *rules* and *criteria* for designation/classification, while the specific list of designated systems/entities is commonly restricted to reduce targeting risk.

4. **Tiering varies widely.** Models range from binary designation (designated vs non-designated) to two-tier and multi-tier schemes (e.g., essential/important; graded obligations), with some jurisdictions relying on sectoral regulation without a single “designation list.”

5. **2025–2026 is a resilience and reporting inflection point.** Recent reforms increasingly emphasize faster incident reporting, ransomware-payment reporting, supply-chain and managed-service-provider scope expansion, and “all-hazards” resilience planning.

## Global Snapshot of Key Regulatory Updates (2025–2026)

| Jurisdiction | Key regulation / update | Current status & deadlines | Impact on health sector |
|---|---|---|---|
| **United Kingdom** | Cyber Security and Resilience (Network and Information Systems) Bill | Introduced Nov 2025. Expected implementation 2026. | Expands scope to Managed Service Providers (MSPs), critical suppliers, and data centres serving healthcare. 24-hour incident reporting. |
| **European Union** | Critical Entities Resilience (CER) Directive & NIS2 Directive | CER: Identify critical entities by 17 July 2026. NIS2: compliance deadlines ongoing. | Health is an explicit sector. CER mandates all-hazard resilience plans. |
| **United States** | Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act (CIRCIA) | Final rule expected May 2026. Reporting begins after rule finalisation. | Will require 72-hour incident reporting and 24-hour ransom payment reporting for covered entities. |
| **Australia** | Mandatory Ransomware Payment Reporting Rules | In force since 30 May 2025. Strict enforcement begins 1 Jan 2026. | Applies to entities with >AUD $3m turnover or responsible for critical infrastructure assets. |

## How to read “critical/protected/high-security” in this report

Different jurisdictions use different legal labels. For consistency, this report treats a health system/operator as “critical/protected/high-security” if it is subject to materially elevated obligations (e.g., mandatory cybersecurity risk management controls, enhanced supervision/audit, compulsory incident reporting, resilience/BCP requirements, or special protection measures) because of the essentiality of the service and the consequences of disruption.

### Designation models (taxonomy used throughout)

- **System-based designation:** specific systems are designated.
- **Entity-based designation:** operators/providers are designated (the systems they run become in-scope).
- **Asset-based designation:** specific assets/facilities are designated (e.g., defined classes of hospitals).
- **Sector-based regulation without a single designation list:** obligations apply to classes of organizations, sometimes with thresholds.

### Evidence labels for “likely in-scope systems” lists

Where the document lists systems “most likely” to be treated as critical, each bullet will be tagged as:

- **(A) Explicit** — directly stated in law/regulation  
- **(B) Guidance** — stated in regulator/authority guidance or official policy documents  
- **(C) Criteria inference** — inferred directly from published designation criteria/thresholds  
- **(D) Expert judgement** — reasoned judgement where sources are incomplete or lists are confidential

## Methodology and Sources

This analysis synthesizes:
- Official legislation and regulations (updated through January 2026)
- Competent-authority guidance documents and consultation papers (where publicly available)
- Selected academic and policy literature
- Multiple independent draft analyses consolidated into a single harmonized structure, then checked against primary sources cited in the reference list

All substantive claims are supported by numbered references in the main text. Where designation lists are confidential, the report distinguishes between what is directly evidenced and what is inferred using the evidence labels above.

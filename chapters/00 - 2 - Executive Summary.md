# Executive Summary

This comparative study analyzes how **17 jurisdictions** classify health-related information systems and operators as critical infrastructure, plus an additional **20+ countries** surveyed across Latin America, ASEAN, Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia. Whether framed as *critical information infrastructure*, *critical entities*, *essential services*, or equivalent constructs, this report identifies global patterns and actionable insights for policymakers.

## Scope of Analysis
| Coverage | Count | Regions |
|:---------|:------|:--------|
| **Deep-dive chapters** | 17 | North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Middle East |
| **Multi-region survey** | 20+ | Latin America, ASEAN, Africa, Central Asia, Eastern Europe |


## Key Findings

1. **Universal prioritization of life-and-safety digital functions.** Across all 17 jurisdictions, consistent prioritization emerges for: emergency dispatch systems, major hospital clinical platforms (EMR/EHR, ICU monitoring), blood and organ allocation services, disease surveillance systems, and national health information exchanges.
2. **Multiple designation models, converging on hybrids.** Approaches include:
   - **Sector-based** (USA, Canada): broad coverage, lower precision
   - **Entity-based** (UK, EU, France): clear accountability, scalable
   - **System-based** (Singapore): precise, but complex to administer
   - **Asset-based** (Australia, Germany): explicit thresholds, easy to verify
   - **Hybrid models** increasingly common: combining quantitative thresholds with qualitative "safety net" criteria
3. **Criteria public; lists often confidential.** Most regimes publish designation *criteria* (enabling self-assessment) while keeping specific entity lists confidential to avoid creating target lists. **Exception:** South Korea publishes designations in the Official Gazette.
4. **Tiering structures vary.** From binary (designated/not) to multi-tier:
   - **Two-tier:** EU NIS2 (Essential/Important), Hong Kong (Category 1/2/3 obligations)
   - **Three-tier:** Israel (Basic/Medium/High database security)
   - **Single-tier + enhanced:** Australia (Critical Hospital → SoNS)
5. **2025–2026: A regulatory inflection point.** Eleven major regulatory milestones across eight jurisdictions are entering force, with convergence toward 24-hour early warning and 72-hour detailed incident reporting.


## Key Regulatory Milestones (2025–2026)

| **1 Oct 2025** | Norway | Digital Security Act in force | Health as "socially important service" |
| **Nov 2025** | UK | Cyber Security Bill introduced | Expands to MSPs, 24h reporting |
| **6 Dec 2025** | Germany | NIS2 implementation law in force | 30,000-case hospital threshold |
| **1 Jan 2026** | Hong Kong | CI Ordinance in force | 12h/48h/14d incident reporting |
| **1 Jan 2026** | Australia | Strict enforcement posture begins | Enhanced supervision of ICU hospitals |
| **May 2026** | USA | CIRCIA final rule expected | 72h incident/24h ransom reporting |
| **17 July 2026** | EU | CER Directive deadline | All-hazard resilience for health |


## Incident Reporting: Global Convergence
| Reporting Stage | Emerging Standard | Jurisdictions |
|:----------------|:------------------|:--------------|
| **Early warning** | 12–24 hours | Hong Kong (12h), Norway (24h), Switzerland (24h), EU NIS2 (24h), UK (24h) |
| **Detailed notification** | 48–72 hours | Hong Kong (48h), Norway (72h), EU NIS2 (72h), USA CIRCIA (72h) |
| **Final report** | 14–30 days | Hong Kong (14d), Norway (1 month), EU NIS2 (1 month) |
| **Ransom payment** | 24 hours | USA CIRCIA, Australia |


## Designation Models (Taxonomy)
| Model | Description | Examples |
|:------|:------------|:---------|
| **System-based** | Specific systems designated | Singapore (CII) |
| **Entity-based** | Operators/providers designated | UK (OES), EU (NIS2), France (OIV) |
| **Asset-based** | Specific facilities designated | Australia (ICU hospitals), Germany (30k cases) |
| **Sector-based** | Obligations apply to classes | USA (HPH sector), Canada (10 CI sectors) |
| **Hybrid** | Combined approaches | Germany (KRITIS + NIS2), Hong Kong |


## Health Entities Most Commonly Designated

**Near-universal inclusion (80%+ of frameworks):**

- Hospitals with ICU/emergency capability
- National/regional health information exchanges
- Blood and organ allocation services
- Disease surveillance systems
- Emergency ambulance dispatch (CAD)
**Frequently included (50–80%):**

- Medical laboratories (reference/diagnostic)
- Pharmaceutical manufacturers/distributors
- Medical device manufacturers


## Evidence Labels

Where this report lists systems "most likely" to be treated as critical:

- **(A) Explicit** — directly stated in law/regulation  
- **(B) Guidance** — stated in official policy documents  
- **(C) Criteria inference** — inferred from published thresholds  
- **(D) Expert judgement** — reasoned where sources are incomplete  


## Methodology

This analysis synthesizes:

- Official legislation and regulations (updated through January 2026)
- Competent-authority guidance documents and consultation papers
- Primary source verification for all 17 deep-dive jurisdictions
- Multi-region survey based on official government and agency sources
All substantive claims are supported by numbered references. Where lists are confidential, the report distinguishes between what is directly evidenced and what is inferred.

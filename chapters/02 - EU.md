# EUROPEAN UNION (NIS2)

### **Legal basis**

**Directive (EU) 2022/2555** on measures for a high common level of cybersecurity across the Union (“NIS2”). ([EUR-Lex][1])


## **Final Categories (what the Directive actually creates)**

### **1) Essential entities**

NIS2 defines **“essential entities”** in **Article 3(1)** (including Annex I entities above the “medium-sized” ceiling, plus several additional categories). ([EUR-Lex][1])

### **2) Important entities**

Entities in scope that **are not essential** are **“important entities”** under **Article 3(2)**. ([EUR-Lex][1])


## **Exact legal / regulatory criteria**

### **Step 1 — Is the entity in an Annex I or Annex II type?**

NIS2 applies to **public or private entities of a type referred to in Annex I or II** (subject to the scope rules below). ([EUR-Lex][1])

### **Step 2 — Size-based scope rule (default rule)**

By default, NIS2 applies to Annex I / Annex II entities that **qualify as medium-sized enterprises** (per EU SME Recommendation) **or exceed the medium-sized ceilings**, and that provide services/carry out activities in the Union. ([EUR-Lex][1])

### **Step 3 — “Regardless of size” triggers (explicit in Article 2(2)–(4))**

Even if below the medium-sized threshold, the Directive **also applies regardless of size** to Annex I/II entities where (among others):

* the entity is the **sole provider** in a Member State of an essential service, **or**
* disruption could have a **significant impact** on **public safety / public security / public health**, **or**
* disruption could induce a **significant systemic risk** (including cross-border impact), **or**
* the entity is critical due to **specific importance at national/regional level** for a sector/service or interdependent sectors. ([EUR-Lex][1])

Also: **entities identified as critical entities under Directive (EU) 2022/2557** fall within scope regardless of size (Article 2(3)). ([EUR-Lex][1])

### **Step 4 — Essential vs Important classification (Article 3)**

* **Essential** includes (a) **Annex I** entities that exceed the medium-size ceilings, plus other listed categories (and Member State identifications under Article 2(2)(b)–(e)). ([EUR-Lex][1])
* **Important** = Annex I/II entities that are in scope but **do not qualify as essential**. ([EUR-Lex][1])


## **Health sector coverage**

### **Annex I (Essential-sector types) — Health**
Annex I includes a **Health** sector with:
* **Health care providers**, and
* **EU reference laboratories**. ([EUR-Lex][1])

### **Annex II (Important-sector types) — Health-adjacent manufacturing**

Annex II includes manufacturing categories that cover (among others):

* **medical devices**,
* **in vitro diagnostic medical devices**, and
* **medicinal products**. ([EUR-Lex][1])

> **Interpretation (explicitly marked):** NIS2’s legal “final categories” are **entity categories** (essential/important). It does **not** itself publish a list of “critical systems” in healthcare; instead it places obligations on the **in-scope entity**, and those obligations practically attach to the network & information systems used to provide the covered services.


## **Grading / tiering schemes**
NIS2’s formal structure is a **two-tier classification**: **Essential** vs **Important**. ([EUR-Lex][1])
It also contains **explicit “regardless of size” inclusion tests** (sole provider / public health impact / systemic risk / special national or regional importance), which function as legal “criticality overrides” for inclusion in scope. ([EUR-Lex][1])


## **Incident reporting (exact timings in the Directive)**

For **significant incidents**, Member States must ensure entities submit:

* **Early warning**: **within 24 hours** of becoming aware. ([EUR-Lex][1])
* **Incident notification**: **within 72 hours** of becoming aware. ([EUR-Lex][1])
* **Final report**: **no later than one month** after the incident notification (with additional progress/final timing for ongoing incidents). ([EUR-Lex][1])

NIS2 also contains a clause allowing authorities, after consulting the entity, to **inform the public** or require the entity to do so where public awareness is necessary / in the public interest. ([EUR-Lex][1])


## **Lists and transparency (what is mandated vs not mandated)**

### **List requirement (mandated)**
By **17 April 2025**, Member States must **establish a list** of essential and important entities (and review/update at least every two years). ([EUR-Lex][1])
Entities must submit minimum identifying information (name, address/contact, sector/subsector, Member States where services are provided). ([EUR-Lex][1])

### **Publication of the list (not mandated in the text shown)**
In the provisions cited above, NIS2 **requires a list to exist** and prescribes information flows (including statistical reporting to the Commission), but it does **not** state that Member States must publish a public registry. ([EUR-Lex][1])
It also explicitly addresses confidentiality constraints on information exchange (confidential business information, etc.). ([EUR-Lex][1])


## **Interpretation: mapping to “health information systems most likely classified”**
*(These are examples to help operationalize the entity-scoped law; they are **not** lists from NIS2 itself.)*
If a **hospital / clinic / health care provider** is in-scope as an essential/important entity, then systems typically implicated will include (as an operational matter): EHR/EMR platforms, PAS, ED/ICU/OR systems, LIS, RIS/PACS, pharmacy/medication systems, blood bank/transfusion systems, identity/access, and supporting infrastructure used to deliver the service.
If **EU reference laboratories** are in-scope, then their surveillance/diagnostic IT (e.g., LIMS and associated data flows) are the most obvious in-scope systems.
If **medical device / IVD / medicinal product manufacturers** are in-scope (Annex II), then manufacturing/quality systems and supporting enterprise IT used to produce/release products are the most obvious in-scope systems.

## **Final categories (what the law actually classifies)**

1. **Critical infrastructure asset (health care and medical sector): “critical hospital”** — a **hospital that has a “general intensive care unit”**. ([Federal Register of Legislation][1])
2. **CIRMP in-scope subset: “designated hospital”** — **a critical hospital mentioned in Schedule 1** of the **Critical infrastructure risk management program Rules (LIN 23/006)**; **Part 2A (CIRMP)** applies to a designated hospital. ([Federal Register of Legislation][2])
3. **Higher-tier classification: “system of national significance (SoNS)”** — the Act creates **Enhanced cyber security obligations** (Part 2C) that operate **in relation to systems of national significance**, including statutory incident response planning obligations and related requirements. ([Federal Register of Legislation][1])


## **Exact legal / regulatory criteria (what triggers inclusion)**

### **A) “Critical hospital” (health CI asset trigger)**

* **Definition (Act):** “critical hospital means a hospital that has a general intensive care unit.” ([Federal Register of Legislation][1])
* **“General intensive care unit” definition (Act):** the Act defines what qualifies as a “general ICU” (capable of mechanical ventilation for several days and invasive cardiovascular monitoring, with specified specialist support). ([Federal Register of Legislation][1])
* **Sector mapping (Act):** “a critical hospital is taken to relate to the health care and medical sector.” ([Federal Register of Legislation][1])
* **Critical infrastructure asset listing (Act):** “critical hospital” is included in the Act’s definition/listing of **critical infrastructure assets**. ([Federal Register of Legislation][1])

### **B) “Designated hospital” (CIRMP / Part 2A trigger)**

* **Definition (Rules):** “designated hospital means a critical hospital mentioned in Schedule 1.” ([Federal Register of Legislation][2])
* **Part 2A application (Rules):** for the Act’s Part 2A application provision, the Rules specify that **Part 2A applies to… (g) a designated hospital**. ([Federal Register of Legislation][2])

### **C) SoNS (Enhanced cyber security obligations trigger)**

* **Enhanced cyber security obligations exist in the Act** (Part 2C), and are expressly framed as relating to **systems of national significance**. ([Federal Register of Legislation][1])
* **Example of SoNS-linked obligation (Act):** the Act sets out SoNS-related requirements around **incident response plans** (including compliance, review, update, and provision to the Secretary), and specifies that an incident response plan for a SoNS must relate to cyber security incidents and plan for responding to incidents with relevant impact. ([Federal Register of Legislation][1])


## **Grading / tiering schemes (what is explicit vs not)**
**What is explicit in instruments (evidentiary):**

* **Binary at the asset layer:** “critical hospital” is the health-sector CI asset class in the Act. ([Federal Register of Legislation][1])
* **CIRMP step-up:** “designated hospital” is a defined subset, and the Rules explicitly apply Part 2A (CIRMP) to it. ([Federal Register of Legislation][2])
* **Further step-up exists for SoNS:** the Act explicitly provides an additional layer of obligations under Part 2C for systems of national significance. ([Federal Register of Legislation][1])

**What is *not* explicit (and should not be asserted as fact):**

* The law does **not** publish a universal “Tier 1/2/3” label scheme for hospitals; any “tiering” language is a **presentation convenience** rather than a statutory classification.


## **Health information systems most likely treated as “high criticality” in practice**
**Interpretation (not a direct statutory list):** The SOCI framework designates **assets (hospitals / SoNS systems)** rather than enumerating specific hospital IT systems. However, the **CIRMP Rules** define **“cyber and information security hazard”** in terms of improper access/misuse of information or computer systems related to the CI asset, or use of computer systems to obtain unauthorised control/access that might impair functioning. ([Federal Register of Legislation][2])
**Interpretation (supported by the obligation scope above):** for **critical hospitals / designated hospitals**, systems that are tightly coupled to delivering the hospital’s critical functions (and whose compromise would plausibly “impair its proper functioning”) are the ones most likely to be operationally prioritised under CIRMP cyber/information security hazards (e.g., core clinical and operational platforms). ([Federal Register of Legislation][2])
**Additional evidentiary hook (Rules):** the Rules explicitly note that **a data storage system** meeting requirements under **subsection 9(7) of the Act** for an in-scope CI asset is **taken to be part of the CI asset**, and include “material risk” examples referencing impacts to ICT/OT and to **data storage systems holding business critical data**. ([Federal Register of Legislation][2])


## **Public vs confidential (what is public, what is not)**
* **Public (criteria/instruments):** the Act and the CIRMP Rules (including the definition of “designated hospital” and the fact Schedule 1 exists) are published. ([Federal Register of Legislation][1])
* **Register / lists not public (Act):** the Act provides that the Secretary must keep a Register and **“must ensure that the Register is not made public.”** ([Federal Register of Legislation][1])

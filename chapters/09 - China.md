# CHINA (PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA)

## Final categories (what is “highest critical / protected”)
1. **关键信息基础设施 (Critical Information Infrastructure, “CII”) —重点保护 / key protection**
   * The Cybersecurity Law provides that the State applies **重点保护 (“key protection”)** to CII in listed sectors, **on the basis of the network security graded protection system (网络安全等级保护制度)**, and delegates the **specific scope and protection measures** to the State Council. ([CAC][1])
2. **关键信息基础设施的运营者 (Operators of CII / “CIIOs”)**
   * The Cybersecurity Law contains a dedicated section on **CII operational security** and sets additional obligations for **CII operators** in that section. ([CAC][1])
3. **《关键信息基础设施安全保护条例》 (State Council Decree No. 745; effective 1 Sept 2021)**
   * These Regulations define CII, establish the supervisory structure, and set out the **industry-regulator “determination / designation” mechanism** (Protection Work Departments drafting designation rules; organizing determinations; notifying operators). ([China Law Translate][2])
4. **Health-sector “highest protected” systems under MLPS (graded protection) — explicit health guidance**
   * The National Health Commission (then Ministry of Health) guidance (2011) states that the **graded protection system has five levels** and lists multiple **health information systems that should be “principally not lower than Level 3.”** ([National Health Commission][3])
   * The NHC/NATCM/NCDC measures (2022) state a principle focusing on protection of **CII**, **MLPS Level 3+ networks**, and **important data/personal information** in healthcare institutions. ([National Health Commission][4])


## Exact legal / regulatory criteria (what triggers inclusion)

### A) The Definition (scope text)
**Cybersecurity Law — CII (Article 33 on CAC text)**
* CII sectors explicitly listed include: **public communications and information services, energy, transportation, water conservancy, finance, public services, e-government**, and “other” CII whose destruction/loss of function/data leakage may seriously endanger national security / people’s livelihood / public interest.
* The provision states this protection is **“on the basis of” the graded protection system**, and that the **specific scope and protection measures are to be formulated by the State Council**. ([CAC][1])
**CII Security Protection Regulations (Decree No. 745) — CII definition (Article 2)**
* Defines CII by (i) listed sectors (includes **public services, e-government**, etc., and also **national defense technology industry**) and (ii) a harm test (destruction/loss of function/data leakage may seriously endanger national security / people’s livelihood / public interest). ([China Law Translate][2])

### B) The Thresholds (tests stated in the instruments)
**Cybersecurity Law (graded protection baseline)**
* The Cybersecurity Law states the State implements the **network security graded protection system** and requires network operators to fulfill specified security protection obligations under that system. ([CAC][1])
**Decree No. 745 designation mechanism — criteria for designation rules (Article 9)**
* Protection Work Departments must draft **designation rules** and file them with the State Council public security department.
* In drafting designation standards, Article 9 lists three factors:
  1. importance of the network facilities/information systems to core operations in the sector;
  2. degree of harm if destroyed / loses function / data leakage;
  3. impact on other industries/sectors. ([China Law Translate][2])
**No numeric thresholds in the designation factors**
* Article 9 provides factors (importance/harm/impact) and does **not** state numeric thresholds. ([China Law Translate][2])


## Grading / tiering scheme
1. **Network security graded protection system (网络安全等级保护制度)**
   * The Cybersecurity Law states that China implements the graded protection system and lists operator obligations under that system. ([CAC][1])
2. **CII protection is explicitly stated as being “on the basis of” graded protection**
   * The Cybersecurity Law provision on CII states **重点保护** for CII **on the basis of** graded protection. ([CAC][1])
3. **Five levels (explicitly stated in the 2011 health-sector guidance)**
   * The 2011 health-sector guidance states: “等级…分为五级” and names each level from Level 1 to Level 5. ([National Health Commission][3])


## Incident reporting tests and thresholds
**Cybersecurity Law (general incident reporting duty)**
* The Cybersecurity Law requires network operators to have incident response plans and to report incidents to competent authorities “according to provisions” (as written in the law). ([CAC][1])
**Decree No. 745 (Article 18) — CIIO reporting trigger**
* CIIOs must report when **major cybersecurity incidents occur** in CII or **major cybersecurity threats are discovered**, to Protection Work Departments and public security organs. ([China Law Translate][2])
**Examples of “especially serious” incidents/threats (Decree No. 745, Article 18)**
* Article 18 gives examples such as **overall interruption of operations / primary function failures**, **leaks of basic state information and other important data**, **large-scale personal information leaks**, **large economic losses**, or **illegal transmission of a larger scope of information**, triggering onward reporting by Protection Work Departments after receipt. ([China Law Translate][2])
**Deadlines**
* Article 18 uses “promptly” for onward reporting by Protection Work Departments after receiving a report; no hour/day deadline is specified in the cited Article 18 text. ([China Law Translate][2])


## Health-sector clauses / guidance (primary, health-specific)

### A) Health systems explicitly “≥ Level 3” in 2011 guidance (NHC/Ministry of Health)
The 2011 guidance states the graded protection system has five levels and then states the following “important health information systems” are **principally not lower than Level 3**:
* **Cross-province national networked systems**:
  * health statistics network direct reporting, infectious disease reporting, health supervision reporting, public health emergency command information systems, etc. ([National Health Commission][3])
* **National/provincial/municipal health information platforms**, and national-level data centers including (examples listed): new rural cooperative medical scheme, health supervision, maternal & child health, etc. ([National Health Commission][3])
* **Core business information systems of Class III Grade A hospitals (三级甲等医院核心业务信息系统).** ([National Health Commission][3])
* **Ministry of Health website system.** ([National Health Commission][3])
* “Other” systems assessed by the technical expert committee as Level 3+ (as written). ([National Health Commission][3])
It also states:
* **Annual level evaluation (等级测评)** for Level 3+ health information systems. ([National Health Commission][3])

### B) Healthcare institution cybersecurity measures (2022)
The 2022 measures state they are made with reference to multiple laws/regulations including the Cybersecurity Law and the **CII Security Protection Regulations**, and include a principle:
* “重点保障关键信息基础设施、网络安全等级保护第三级及以上网络以及重要数据和个人信息安全” (focus protection on CII, MLPS Level 3+ networks, important data and personal information). ([National Health Commission][4])


## Health information systems “most likely” designated
**Not determinable from the cited CII national instruments alone.**
* The CII Security Protection Regulations assign designation to sector Protection Work Departments and require sector designation rules (Articles 9–11). The Regulations do not, in the cited text, list healthcare systems by name as “CII.” ([China Law Translate][2])
**What is explicitly stated for health (separate from CII designation)**
* The 2011 and 2022 health-sector instruments explicitly identify multiple health systems as **MLPS Level 3+ targets** and identify protection of **CII** and **MLPS Level 3+ networks** as priorities in healthcare institutions. ([National Health Commission][3])


## Public vs confidential (what the primary texts show)
* **Public (instruments):** the Cybersecurity Law text (including the CII chapter) and Decree No. 745 text are publicly available (official Chinese; translations exist). ([CAC][1])
* **Designation outcomes:** Decree No. 745 states operators are **notified** of designation results and that determinations are **reported** to the State Council public security department. ([China Law Translate][2])
* **A public national list of CIIOs is not present in these instruments’ text** (i.e., the cited law/regulation text does not contain a list). ([CAC][1])


## Latest updates (2025–2026) — primary confirmation
* Xinhua reports the NPCSC passed the decision amending the Cybersecurity Law on **28 Oct 2025** and that it **takes effect 1 Jan 2026**. ([Xinhua News][5])
* The CAC page for the Cybersecurity Law states the law is **revised according to the 2025-10-28 NPCSC decision** (as shown in the header). ([CAC][1])

## Overall Tier Distribution

| Tier | Count | Percentage | Representative Entities |
|:-----|:-----:|:----------:|:------------------------|
| **Tier 1** | 20 | 91% | National platforms, major hospitals, surveillance systems, manufacturers |
| **Tier 2** | 1 | 4.5% | Regional HMIS (5 hospitals) |
| **Tier 3** | 1 | 4.5% | Small CHC |

> [!NOTE]
> The high proportion of Tier 1 classifications reflects the **intentional selection of diverse critical entities** for illustration. In practice, most health sector entities (small clinics, standalone pharmacies, individual practitioners) would be Tier 3 or unclassified.

## Key Insights Across All Case Studies

### Healthcare Delivery

1. **Geographic factors outweigh scale in developing countries**: Sole district hospitals qualify for Tier 1 regardless of size
2. **Private chains can be CII**: Large networks with centralized systems warrant high classification
3. **Telemedicine hubs have access-based criticality**: Remote populations depend on these as sole specialist access points
4. **Medical colleges have triple criticality**: Clinical care + research + workforce training compound the risk

### Digital Health Platforms

5. **National platforms are automatic Tier 1**: Any national-level health information system triggers automatic classification
6. **Data aggregation creates concentrated risk**: PHR platforms aggregating from thousands of sources have unique criticality
7. **HMIS scale determines tier**: 500+ facilities = Tier 1; 5 facilities = Tier 2

### Diagnostics, Pharma & Biotech

8. **Major diagnostic chains are CII**: Laboratories with significant market share and surveillance roles qualify for Tier 1
9. **Genomic data has unique sovereignty implications**: Population genomics is a national asset requiring special protection
10. **Supply chain entities are CII**: Vaccine/pharma manufacturers with significant market share are Critical Infrastructure
11. **IP-based criticality is valid**: High-value biotech research IP warrants CII consideration for economic security

### Public Health Programs & Surveillance

12. **National surveillance is foundational CII**: Pandemic preparedness depends on surveillance system integrity
13. **Disease control programs have supply chain dependencies**: TB drugs, IOL distribution, nutrition supplements are attack vectors
14. **NCD programs need longitudinal integrity**: Chronic disease tracking requires decade-long data protection
15. **Child health programs are life-critical**: Nutrition monitoring directly affects child mortality

### Registries, Biobanks & Blood Services

16. **Disease registries support public health planning**: National registry data is irreplaceable
17. **Biobanks need hybrid security**: Physical sample integrity + cyber data protection are equally critical
18. **Blood services are life-critical**: Real-time coordination for emergency transfusions has immediate mortality implications

## Using These Case Studies

### For Policymakers

- Use case studies to **illustrate framework application** to stakeholders
- Adapt scoring criteria based on **local context and thresholds**
- Reference developing country adaptations for **proportionate implementation**

### For Regulators

- Use as **templates for self-assessment questionnaires**
- Apply scoring methodology consistently across entities
- Consider **system-level** as well as entity-level classification

### For Covered Entities

- **Self-assess** using the scoring methodology
- Identify applicable **obligations by tier**
- Plan for **phased compliance** based on tier assignment

### For Technical Implementers

- Use obligation lists to **scope security programs**
- Design **shared services** (SOCs, audits) for Tier 2/3 entities
- Plan **incident reporting workflows** based on tier timelines

### Legal Basis
* **Basic Act on Cybersecurity (Act No. 104 of 2014)** — establishes the national cybersecurity policy framework and defines *critical social infrastructure providers* as those providing infrastructure foundational to people’s lives/economic activity where failure/deterioration would have enormous impact.
* **Cybersecurity Policy for Critical Infrastructure Protection** (Cybersecurity Strategic Headquarters; June 17, 2022; revised March 8, 2024) — sets the government-wide CIP framework and terminology for CI operators, CI sectors, CI services, and “critical information systems”.

### Final Categories (as used in the CIP framework)
From the **Cybersecurity Policy for Critical Infrastructure Protection**:
* **CI sectors**: the policy glossary enumerates CI sectors including **“medical services”** (among other sectors).
* **CI operators**: defined in the policy as “critical social infrastructure providers” (per the Basic Act) and further scoped via **ANNEX 1**.
* **Critical information systems**: information systems required to provide CI services, designated for each CI operator based on degree of impact on CI services.

### “Medical services” as a CI sector — what the policy explicitly says
**ANNEX 1 (scope/examples) includes:**
* **Medical services — Medical facilities (excluding small scale facilities)**, with example critical information systems such as:
  * “medical examination record management systems”
  * “medical examination support systems”
  * “community medical care support systems”
**ANNEX 2 (service explanation/outage examples) includes for medical services:**
* CI service: “medical examination / examination and treatment”
* Example impacts: hindrance to medical examination support departments; malfunction of medical equipment threatening human life
* Referenced guidance: “Guideline on Safety Management of Medical Information Systems”

### Health-sector cybersecurity governance signals from MHLW (evidence from your PDFs)
From **MHLW “Basic Policy for Cyber-security Measures at Medical Facilities”**:
* The policy context explicitly places healthcare cyber measures alongside:
  * “Basic Act on Cyber-security”
  * “Fourth action plan on information security measures for critical infrastructure”
  * and depicts **Healthcare CEPTOAR** within the information-sharing / reporting ecosystem. 
* It also describes preparation of a **checklist** to facilitate checks at medical facilities and indicates positioning cybersecurity-measure status checks as part of **on-site inspection** framing. 
From **Guidelines on Safety Management of Healthcare Information Systems (Ver. 6.0 outline/major points)**:
* The version history explicitly notes that **Version 2** was “revised from the viewpoint of healthcare information systems as **critical infrastructure**.” 
* It also notes that because **online qualification check** became mandatory (from April 2023), “almost all medical facilities, etc., are required to take the network-related security measures” described in the guidelines. 

### Medical devices cybersecurity (incident handling / reporting) — evidence
From the **PMDA/MHLW English reference translation you uploaded (000272598.pdf)**:
* It describes cybersecurity expectations across the lifecycle (pre-market resilience; post-market vulnerability correction/patching; incident handling) and provides for reporting pathways/forms to PMDA in the described framework. 

### Grading / Tiering schemes (what we can and cannot claim evidentially)
* **No public numeric thresholding for “medical CI” appears in the CI policy text** (it uses the qualitative boundary “medical facilities (excluding small scale facilities)” in ANNEX 1).
* The CIP framework does define **information-sharing structures and policy measures**, but **a public hospital-tier scoring rubric (A/B/C or Tier 1/2/3)** is **not evidenced** by the sources opened above, so it is **omitted** here.

### Health information systems most defensibly “in-scope / critical” (evidence-limited list)
Based strictly on **ANNEX 1 examples for “medical services”** in the CIP policy:
* Medical examination record management systems
* Medical examination support systems
* Community medical care support systems

### Final category

Canada’s top-level framing for “critical / protected” health systems is **sector-based**:

1. **Critical Infrastructure (CI) — “Health” sector** (one of **10** CI sectors in Canada’s National Strategy / Public Safety Canada CI framework). ([Public Safety Canada][1])
2. **Federally regulated “critical cyber systems” (designation-based obligations) — via Bill C-8 / proposed CCSPA framework** for **designated operators** of certain **vital services/systems** within Parliament’s jurisdiction (not a “health CI designation list,” but relevant to cross-cutting dependencies such as telecom, energy/pipelines, transport, banking/clearing). ([Ministère de la Justice][2])


### Exact legal / policy criteria used

#### A) National Critical Infrastructure (Public Safety Canada) — public definition + sector model

**CI definition (public):** CI refers to “processes, systems, facilities, technologies, networks, assets and services” essential to Canadians’ health/safety/security/economic well-being and the effective functioning of government. ([Public Safety Canada][1])

**Sector list (public):** The National Strategy enumerates **ten CI sectors**, explicitly including **Health**. ([Public Safety Canada][1])

**How inclusion works (important):** This is a **resilience / partnership framework**, not a single national law that publishes a universal, named list of “designated health information systems.” The Strategy emphasizes:

* **shared responsibilities** across federal/provincial/territorial governments, local authorities, and owners/operators, with owners/operators bearing primary responsibility for protecting assets/services; ([Public Safety Canada][1])
* an **all-hazards risk management approach** and improved **information sharing/protection** among partners. ([Public Safety Canada][1])

#### B) Federal designation-based cyber obligations (Bill C-8 / CCSPA concept)

**What CCSPA would do (as described by Justice Canada):**

* **Part 2** would enact the **Critical Cyber Systems Protection Act (CCSPA)** to protect “critical cyber systems” supporting **vital services/systems** within Parliament’s jurisdiction that are vital to national security or public safety. ([Ministère de la Justice][2])
* It would authorize designation of **classes of operators (“designated operators”)** who own/control/operate critical cyber systems; these operators would have specified obligations. ([Ministère de la Justice][2])
* “Vital” systems/services initially include sectors such as **telecommunications**, **pipelines/power lines**, **nuclear energy**, **transportation**, **banking** and **clearing/settlement**, with potential additions by Governor in Council. ([Ministère de la Justice][2])

**Bill text purpose clause (primary text):** the purpose is to protect critical cyber systems to support continuity/security of vital services/systems, including managing cyber risks (incl. supply chain/third-party), protecting systems from compromise, detecting incidents, and minimizing impacts. ([Parliament of Canada][3])


### Grading / tiering scheme

Canada’s CI model is primarily **sector-in-scope** (e.g., “Health” as a CI sector) rather than a published graded tiering of all health information systems. ([Public Safety Canada][1])

Under the CCSPA approach (if enacted), the main “tier” is **designation status**:

* **designated operator** vs **non-designated operator** (federally regulated vital service/system operators). ([Ministère de la Justice][2])


### “Higher security” triggers relevant to health (what becomes critical in practice)

Because Canada’s national CI approach is sector + consequence + interdependency (rather than a single national list), the most “critical / higher-security” health systems are typically those whose disruption plausibly causes:

* **loss of vital services** or **harm / loss of life**, which Cyber Centre CI guidance highlights as potential CI impacts; ([Canadian Centre for Cyber Security][4])
* **hospital operational disruption** / compromised medical devices (explicitly called out as a CI cyber-impact risk). ([Canadian Centre for Cyber Security][5])

This supports prioritizing, in practice (examples, not an official list): core hospital operational platforms, emergency workflows, key diagnostic and medication systems, public health coordination platforms, and enterprise identity/network controls that have wide “blast radius.”


### Public vs confidential

**Public**

* CI definition and the **10-sector list including Health** are explicitly public. ([Public Safety Canada][1])
* Federal legislative instruments (Bill text, Charter Statement, legislative summaries) are public. ([Parliament of Canada][3])

**Typically not public (operational practice)**

Specific, organization-level inventories of “most critical” systems (within hospitals/provinces/health authorities) are generally managed via risk management and operational security processes implied by the partnership/owner-operator responsibility model, rather than published as a single universal national register in the cited framework. ([Public Safety Canada][1])
